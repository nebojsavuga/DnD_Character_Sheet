# Dungeons And Dragons Character Sheet 

This project was made by me when i was 17 years old. It was for a competition called the RAF Challenge in which highschoolers from Serbia make an visual app bassed on a subject that the Challenge makers give.
For the year that i competed, the challenge was to make an app that will help with some kind of social/board game.
I choose to create a DnD Characteer Sheet creator with an option to Save it to the Database, Edit it, Delete it, and to **Export the sheet to PDF.**
This project earned me the third place in the competition consisting of around 30-40 students.
